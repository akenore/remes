Our physician relies on a network of specialists who are quickly available for our residents. Thanks to our partnerships with accredited clinics, including the international CARTHAGE MÃ‰DICAL center and the ESSALEM clinic in Sousse, access to tests and hospital care is made easier. And because no resident should face these moments alone, we always provide transportation and attentive support from our nursing assistants, who stay by their side for as long as needed.
